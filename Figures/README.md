* **granger_fig4.m:**
*Main file to generate granger causality figures.*

* **granger_fig4_mvgc.m:**
*Performs spectral GC calculations per ripple for all conditions. Then saves on .mat files. This takes a very long time.* :warning: 

* **granger_fig4_mvgc_stats.m:**
*Continuation of above which loads previously saved computations and performs permutation tests among conditions per frequency.*
