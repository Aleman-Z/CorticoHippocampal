-Cross-Frequency coupling. :dizzy:
------------------
Main script is shared with Granger causality analysis main script: **granger_fig4.m**

* **crossfreq.m:**  
*Performs CFC coupling of ripple-centered epochs.* 

* **ft_crossfrequencyanalysis:**  
*Fieldtrip function used to perform CFC analysis. Methods: coh, plv, mvl and mi * 

* **crossfreq_single.m:**  
*Extracts High and Low frequencies spectrums of a region to be used in further CFC analysis.*
