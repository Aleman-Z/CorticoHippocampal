# CorticoHippocampal
INTERNSHIP PROJECT by> Adrián Alemán
--------------------------------
DESCRIPTION of MAIN FUNCTIONS:

-PERIODOGRAMS
---------------
psd_epochs_intraconditions: Generates Power plots of NREM signals for all conditions in a specific brain area. 

psd_epochs_intraconditions: Generates Power plots of NREM signals for all brain areas during a specific condition. 

-DATA DESCRIPTION
-----------------
time_of_sleep: Gives information per condition about amount of sleep, number of ripples found, threshold values, and rate of occurence.
 
plot_number_ripples: Plots information obtained from the above function. 

-SCATTER PLOTS
--------------
psd_ripples: Generates scatter plots to show difference between spectral power among conditions wrt the hippocampal power. 

psd_ripples2: Same but using bandpassed signals of PAR and PFC.

psd_ripples3: Same but using Wideband signals of PAR and PFC.


-SPECTROGRAMS AND GC
--------------------
main_optimized_ab: Main analysis. 

-HISTOGRAMS
----------------
ripple_amplitude: Generates normalized histogram of the amplitude of the 1000 strongest ripples in the Hippocampus. 

between_ripples: Histogram of time between ripples for different conditions.
