--------------------------------
DESCRIPTION of MAIN FUNCTIONS:

-PERIODOGRAMS
---------------
psd_epochs_intraconditions: Generates Power plots of NREM signals for all conditions in a specific brain area. 

psd_epochs_intraconditions: Generates Power plots of NREM signals for all brain areas during a specific condition. 

-DATA DESCRIPTION
-----------------
time_of_sleep: Gives information per condition about amount of sleep, number of ripples found, threshold values, and rate of occurence.
 
plot_number_ripples: Plots information obtained from the above function. 

-SCATTER PLOTS
--------------
psd_ripples: Generates scatter plots to show difference between spectral power among conditions wrt the hippocampal power. 

-SPECTROGRAMS AND GC
--------------------
main_optimized_ab: Main analysis.
