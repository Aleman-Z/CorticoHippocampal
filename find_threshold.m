%%
%Redo original rat 26 using the SAME threhold value for all events. 

%This leads to some posibilities>
%1) Use different thresholds for each condition. 
%2)Use same thresholds for each condition. 
%3)Use another approach, such as using the same rate of occurence. 


%% Same threhold approach
%1)Using same threholds between condition and baseline. USE THE %2 Approach
%using the smallest valur of thr.  %REPEAT twice for BASELINE 1 AND
%BASELINE 2

%2)Using same threholds between condition and baseline. USE THE SAME VALUE
%AS RAT 26: 125 for thr1 and proceed to divide by 2 consequently. 

%Grab 100 random ripples, like before!
%% Different threholds 


%Last week approach. 

%Repeat what you did last week before BUT use the 750 largest amplitudes. 

%new suggestions. 
%% Optimal thresholding
% Find the threshold that gives a number of ripples that gives the closest
% value to the Freq. Occur from Rat 26.
